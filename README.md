# SpeedBotW
A twitter Bot that checks internet speed(up&amp;down) using speedtest.com and tweets it. 
It compares the current internet speed(up&amp;down) with the speed promised by your internet provider and calls out the discrepancy
I made this bot, because my internet provider is shitty, and i was frustated with the internet speed,
So thought why not make a project out of it.🙅‍♂️
